The main aim is for me is to familiarize with molecular similarity using various calcula4on
methods, leveraging fingerprints. Fingerprints encode molecules by the presence or absence
of structural fragments, represen4ng them as vectors of thousands of bits, each bit
corresponding to a structural fragment. Using a reference molecule, virtual screening can be
performed based on structural fingerprints.
